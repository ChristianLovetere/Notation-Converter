# Notation-Converter
A set of source files and headers that altogether allow the user to convert between infix, postfix, and prefix freely. Uses a deque of chars to store operands or operators (depending on the method) and assign them in the proper order. Some methods require a flag for order assignment, while most use the size of the deque.
